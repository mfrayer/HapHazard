HAPHAZARD INPUT FILE

This file will serve as a template for HapHazard input. The lines will be read by a Perl driving
script and used for input by HapHazard. Please read the instructions below.
 
INSTRUCTIONS:

Lines that begin with a '>' will be read as input. All other lines will be ignored and can be used 
make notes or comments. The lines already contained in the file contain basic instructions and labels
for lines of input. For more detailed instruction please see the HapHazard manual.

HapHazard requires that all parameters be entered in the correct order.

*** DO NOT DELETE OR ALTER THE ORDER OF THE INPUT PARAMETERS! *** 

If you do so, HapHazard will likely crash or not run as expected. It is recommended that you maintain
an unaltered template version of this file in case errors are made while altering the file for
various experiments.

Variable names below are on comment lines and named in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES_FOR_SPACES to 
distinguish them from variable types given in lowercase letters surrounded by carrots, <>. 
Descriptions or instructions are given on lines following the variable name.

Enter your variables on a line following the variable type after the '>' using the type 
indicated above it. Leave a space between the '>' and the value Note: the term double, if you are not 
familiar with it indicates a decimal number. The term double is used by computer scientists to indicate
memory size andprecision. Don't worry about it, just enter a decimal.

List variables are given one line with individual variables separated by spaces. Be aware of when # lists 
need to correspond to one another. Many are warned of below, see the manual for details.

This format can be tedious. Please take some extra time to prepare your list of parameters
before entering them to avoid errors.

EXPERIMENT_NAME
This is a label for your experiment and will be used to name output files and directories.
<text>

NUMBER_OF_SIMULATIONS
The total number of simulations you would like to run
If running jobs in parallel on a computer cluster, normally this should be set to 1.

<integer>

> 500

NUMBER_OF_DEMES
The number of demes found in your metapopulation, ignoring source populations
<integer>

> 1

DEME_SIZES
The number of individuals found in each deme. Enter as a list on one line separated by spaces.
Make sure the number of list entries matches the number of demes.
<integer_list>

> 500

NUMBER_OF_ANCESTRIES
The number of ancestries that exist in the population.

> 2

ANCESTRY_FREQUENCIES
A list of each ancestry's frequency by deme. List each ancestry as they exist in each deme.
The ancestry frequencies in each deme MUST SUM TO 1.0.
For example: ancesty1_deme1, ancestry2_deme1, ancestry1_deme2, ancestry2_deme2, etc.
<double_list>

> 0.5 0.5

MATING_SYSTEM
The type of sex determination and mating system
Enter: 0 for Hermaphrodites, 1 for XX females and XY males, or 2 for WZ females and ZZ males
<integer>

> 1

MIGRATION_RATES
The proportion of individuals exchanged between pairs of demes each generation. Demes receive
N* m/2 individuals from neighboring demes. Including migration with source populations, there
should be the number of demes plus one migration rates. If you do not wish to include source
populations, the first and last entry should be 0.
<double_list>

> 0 0

NUMBER_OF_CHROMOSOMES
The number of chromosomes per haplotype. This includes up to one pair of sex chromosomes and
one cytoplasmic chromosome.
<integer>

> 3

RECOMBINATION_MODEL
This parameter toggle the type of recombination used in the simulations
0 = one crossover per chromosome
1 = Poisson crossovers, no interference
2 = Gamma Interference
<integer>

> 1

CHROMOSOME_TYPES
List the types of chromosomes used in the simulation. This list must correspond with other
chromosome parameter lists.
IMPORTANT NOTE: the sexchromosome pair, if used MUST be listed first, followed by any number of 
autosomes, and the cytoplams MUST be listed last
Options:<0> = autosomal pair, <2> = XY sex chromosome pair, <4> = ZW sex chromosome pair,  <5> = 
mitochondrion, <6> = chloroplast, <7> = paternally inherited cytoplasm
<integer_list>

> 2 0 5

CHROMOSOME_LENGTHS
List the genetic length, in Morgans, of each chromosome in the same order the types appear in.
The cytoplasm must be set to length 0.
<double_list>

> 1.0 1.0 0

PSEUDO_AUTOSOMAL_REGION
Set the genetic length of the pseudoautosomal region. In males, recombination between the X and Y
is restricted to this fraction of the XY pair. If you wish to ignore it, set it to 0.
<double>

> 0.01

NUMBER_OF_PHENOTYPES
The number of phenotypes to be modelled in the simulation. By default, simulations have three
phenotypes: reproductive fitness, developmental fitness, and environmental fitness.
If you wish to track additional phenotypes, as defined by your genes, enter a number greater than
three, to accept only the default phenotypes (which you may ignore if you wish) enter a three.
<integer>

> 6

EXPECTED_PHENOTYPIC_VALUES
List the expected value of each phenotype. The genetic effects will be added later.
See the manual for the phenotypic model being used. The fitnesses will be set to a
expected value of 1.0 automatically. Only list the extra phenotypes you have included.
If you have not added any phenotypes beyond three, the list will be ignored.
<double_list>

> 1.0 1.0 1.0

NUMBER_OF_GENES
Enter the number of genes you wish to define in the experiment.
<integer>

> 2

GENE_PARAMETERS
For each gene you wish to describe, list:
its chromosome (the index in the genome list, 0...n-1)
its position in Morgans, 
the index of the phenotype it affects, 
then the additive effect on the phenotype for each ancestry. 
Make sure you list add've effects for each ancestry.
Make sure the number of lines matches the number of genes specified above.
Otherwise, the program will crash, or run improperly.

NUMBER_OF_INTERACTIONS
Indicate how many epistatic interactions you would like to model.
<integer>

> 1

GENETIC_INTERACTIONS
Now we will list definitions of the interactions
On a single line for each interaction, list
The index of the first gene followed by the second. The index is the number, 0...n-1, of the
gene in the list that that you specified earlier.
Next list the ancestries of each gene that interacts in the same order.
Follow this by the maximum phenotypic effect allowed for the loci (see manual for details)
Next is the index of the phenotype the interaction effects.
Finally, indicate the type of model you would like the interaction to follow from:
0 = recessive, 1 = dominant, 2 = dom-rec, 3 = additive (see the manual for details)

SAMPLE_SIZE
Enter the number of individuals you would like to collect from each deme when summary statistics
are calculated
<integer>

MARKER_SPACING
Indicate the size of the interval in Morgans between genetic markers. 
<double>

> 0.01

SUMMARY_GENERATIONS
List the generations, 0...t-1, in which you would like to collect summary statistics.
At the end of the list, include a number outside the range (this tells the program to stop
reading the list)
<integer_list>

SUMMARY_STATS
List a boolean value, 0 = false, 1 = true, to turn off or on (respectively) the summary statistics

And that's it!
